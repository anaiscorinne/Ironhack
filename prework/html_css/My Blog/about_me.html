			<h1>Hi I am Anais :)</h1>
			<p>So here is a little bit about me:</p>
			<ul style="text-align: left">
				<li>I just became an Ironhack student and am learning how to be a junior web developer.</li>
				<li>I spent 7 years living in Rome and travelling around Europe (mostly I was studying and then working for the United Nations).</li>
				<li>I speak 3 languages fluently, and learned quite a bit of conversational Italian while I lived abroad.</li>
				<li>I was raised in Miami, and after many years of being spread across the globe, my immediate family all lives here.</li>
				<li>I've worked in all sorts of different jobs, anywhere from dog walker and babysitter, to personal chef, UN reporting associate, cocktail server, and nail salon manager.</li>
				<li>I love food, books and movies, nature, and especially exploring the world and getting to meet all different kinds of people!</li>
			</ul>

			That's my best friend Nicole on the left, and me. She lives in London and I almost never get to see her. But we always try to reunite at least once a year! We took that photo during my birthday recently! That's my best friend Nicole on the left, and me. She lives in London and I almost never get to see her.

			<h1> Favorite places to eat</h1>
			<p>Since I love food so much, I thought I should tell you guys my top ten restaurants:</p>
			<ol style="text-align: left">
				<li><strong>Lucali</strong> - pizza is one of my favorite foods.</li>
				<li><strong>Kush</strong> - who doesn't love a good burger?</li>
				<li><strong>Bombay Darbar</strong> - because how can one enjoy life without Indian food?</li>
				<li><strong>The Gang</strong>s - to get my Asian fix.</li>
				<li><strong>Pubbelly Sushi</strong> - nom nom nom.</li>
				<li><strong>Here Comes the Sun</strong> - I will never not love it.</li>
				<li><strong>Steve's</strong> - for a high school throwback and great slice!</li>
				<li><strong>27</strong> - overpriced, but oh so worth it!</li>
				<li><strong>Sugarcane</strong> - because I always, still to this day, want to order everything on the meny, evertime I go.</li>
				<li><strong>Shake Shack</strong> - I just love it.</li>
